      <h1>Air Quality Map Area Bekasi Google Earth Engine</h1>

      Air quality describes how clean or polluted the air is. It's crucial for
      health and the environment since clean air means freedom from harmful
      substances. Pollutants, monitoring, standards, and the Air Quality Index
      (AQI) all impact air quality. AQI reports daily air quality, with higher
      values indicating more pollution and potential health risks. Various land,
      sea, and satellite instruments help monitor air quality, set standards,
      and report the AQI.

      The direction of development of this map leads to the final result in the
      form of an air quality index or AQI map with coverage not only in Bekasi
      city, but also throughout Indonesia. This is possible because the code
      used to create this map can be easily modified. To change the coverage of
      the map, it is enough to import the shp of Indonesian boundaries.

      I used imagery from the Sentinel 5P satellite as the basis for creating
      this map. This air quality map is planned to consist of several maps. The
      maps include

      By combining this information, the map provides a comprehensive and
      in-depth picture of the various air quality parameters in the region.
